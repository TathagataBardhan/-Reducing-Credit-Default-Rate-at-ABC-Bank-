### Objective -

### Methodology -
1. Univariate Analysis - Analysing characteristics of the risky customers like age, credit amount, nature of accounts, no. of credits etc. using Multiple Bar plots, Density Plots etc.
2. Bivariate Analysis - Analyzing association of Credit Risk Status with Categorical independent variables using multiple bar diagrams, Chi Square test of independence & with the other Continuous independent variables using Boxplots. 
3. Train - Test split
4. Fitting a Logistic Regression model on train dataset to detect the risky customers â€“ validating the fitted model on test set.
